# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
  Slither quest 



## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")
  a game where a user-controlled snake moves around the screen eating apples/dots and gets longer as it eats more fruits for points.


## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
  The Snake Color Rush game is an exciting twist on the classic Snake game, incorporating dynamic color changes, increasing difficulty, and a high score tracking system. Developed using Python and the Pygame library, the game challenges players to control a snake that moves in four directions while consuming randomly spawning colored balls. Each time the snake eats a ball, it changes to a new random color and grows longer, with its speed gradually increasing to make the game more challenging. If the snake collides with itself, the game ends, displaying a "Game Over" screen. The game features a randomized ball spawning system, ensuring varied gameplay, and a high score tracking feature that saves and displays the player's best performance. The interface will be simple yet engaging, with real-time score updates at the top of the screen. Using Pygame for rendering and user input, the game will run on Windows, macOS, and Linux, requiring only Python and Pygame to execute. A file-based storage system (such as a text file or JSON) will be used to save and retrieve the high score. With its increasing speed mechanics and engaging color-changing effects, Snake Color Rush aims to provide players with an exciting and competitive gaming experience.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
  snake character can move in four directions, and get longer when it consumes a ball/fruit, keeps track of the score, and a game over the screen.


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline? 
  add music to the game, a color-changing snake, a restart button, a reset button, and the ability to name a snake.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
  The snake character can move in four directions and gets longer when it consumes a ball or fruit. It keeps track of the score, and a game is played over the screen. music to the game, a color-changing snake, a restart button, a reset button, and the ability to name a snake.


## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
   I would have to know/learn how to work with Pygame and the way it operates, my first step would be to create a background for the game to start off. creating the snake character. I would need to research how I can make the snake move the way I want.
